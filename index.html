    <h1>Hello, CCS640</h1>
    <p>My first web page hosted on Microsoft Azure.</p>
    <p>Hello everyone! I'm Esther, 
        I am currently residing in Maryland with my husband,
         who is a US veteran. My educational journey began with a bachelor's degree in law,
          but over the years, 
          I have explored various fields in search of something that truly resonates with my passion. 
          This quest led me to the IT industry, where I have spent over a decade honing my skills.
           I am knowledgeable in Linux, DevOps, and I'm currently delving deeper into cloud computing.
        Outside of work, love traveling , cooking, and 
        creating contents for my social present.
         My aspirations for the future is to continue growing in the IT field,
          especially in cloud technologies, 
          and to integrate my varied interests into my professional life where possible.
           I have joined this class to expand my knowledge and skills further,
            connect with like-minded individuals, and explore new opportunities in the IT industry.
             I am eager to learn from all of you and hope to share my experiences and insights as well. 
             Let us make this journey a fruitful 
             and enriching experience for all of us and happy new year to all.
        
        Thanks.</p>
